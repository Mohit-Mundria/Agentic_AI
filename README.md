# 🤖 Agentic AI – Autonomous News Summarizer & Analyst 
**Work in Progress (WIP)**

## 📌 What is Agentic AI?  
Agentic AI refers to **AI systems that go beyond passive responses**. Unlike traditional AI (which only outputs text or predictions), **Agentic AI can plan, decide, and take actions autonomously** to achieve goals on behalf of users.  

It combines:  
- **Autonomy** → The AI acts with minimal user input.  
- **Reasoning** → The AI can analyze and decide what step to take next.  
- **Tool Use** → The AI interacts with APIs, databases, and external systems.  
- **Learning** → Continuously improving through feedback and interaction.  

In short, **Agentic AI = AI that not only answers, but also acts.**

## ⚡ Fundamentals of Agentic AI  
1. **Planning & Goal-Oriented Behavior** – Break down tasks into steps.  
2. **Memory & Context Handling** – Store and reuse past information.  
3. **Tool/Environment Interaction** – Call APIs, trigger actions, fetch data.  
4. **Autonomous Decision-Making** – Choose the next step without explicit human instruction.  
5. **Feedback Loops** – Improve results by learning from errors and outcomes.

## 🛠 Current Progress  
In the current version (`project.ipynb`):  
- ✅ Fetch news articles using a **News API**  
- ✅ Summarize the news content  
- ✅ Perform **Sentiment Analysis**  
- ✅ Assign an **Impact Score**  
- ✅ Automatically **send results via email**  

👉 User only needs to provide:  
- **Company Name**  
- **Recipient Email**  

Everything else happens **autonomously**!

## 🔮 What’s Next? (Future Roadmap)  
- 📊 **Trend Analysis** – Track sentiment impact over time.  
- 📩 **Multi-Recipient Email Support** – Send to multiple stakeholders.  
- 📈 **Interactive Dashboard** – Visualize sentiment, impact, and news trends.  
- 🧠 **Agentic Decision Layer** – Allow the system to decide *when* and *what* news matters most.

## 🚀 Why this project?  
As a **BCA 5th Semester student**, my goal is to **apply theoretical AI knowledge to practical, real-world use cases**.  
This project demonstrates:  
- Knowledge of **NLP, sentiment analysis, and summarization**  
- Understanding of **Agentic AI concepts**  
- Practical skills in **automation, API integration, and workflow design**
